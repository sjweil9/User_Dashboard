# User_Dashboard
A basic Django CRUD app

Supports login/registration with basic validation, with the first user created serving as Admin. 
Users can update their own profiles, and Admins can update ANY profile, with the option to make that user an Admin.
Users can also post messages on other Users' "Walls," and can post replies to any of those posts. 

There is currently no ability to delete or update any posts or replies.
